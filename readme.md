# Nicholas's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio page! This is where you can learn more about me and my work as a full stack developer. With over 3 years of experience, I have knowledge of frontend tools like SASS/SCSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as backend tools like Node, Express, and PostgresSQL. My passion for coding is matched only by my love for anime movies and comics.

On this page, you'll find examples of my work, including websites and applications I've built, as well as links to my GitHub repositories and social media profiles. Whether you're interested in working with me or just want to connect, I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks for stopping by!
